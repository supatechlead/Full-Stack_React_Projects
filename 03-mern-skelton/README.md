### MERN FRONTEND and BACKEND skelton

In this chapter, we completed the **02-mern-skelton** application by adding a React frontend, including frontend routing and basic server-side rendering of the React views.\
To run the server as we develop the code for only the backend, we can start with the **`yarn development`** script in the **package.json** file.\
Open the root URL in the browser, which is http://localhost:3000 if you are using your local machine.
